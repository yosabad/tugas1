## Intro to Data Science and AI Assigments

This project is intended to implement **Clustering** using K-Means algorithm and Agglomerative algorithm using dendogram.

The dataset is about *penguin* which has four attributes: 'pulau_habitat', 'panjang_paruh_atas', 'tebal_paruh_atas', 'panjang_sirip', 'massa_tubuh', and 'jenis_kelamin'. 

From this project, I knew that K-Means algorithm is worked by initializing K-random centroids, assign each data points to the nearest centroids, update the centroid by calculating the mean of each data points, and repeat until the centroids no longer change significantly. Besides that, Agglomerative works by assigning two nearest data points into one cluster and repeat it until the given number of clusters is satisfied.
