## Intro to Data Science and AI Assigments

This project is intended to implement **Clustering** using K-Means algorithm and Agglomerative algorithm using dendogram.

The dataset is about *penguin* which has four attributes: 'pulau_habitat', 'panjang_paruh_atas', 'tebal_paruh_atas', 'panjang_sirip', 'massa_tubuh', and 'jenis_kelamin'. 

From this project, I knew that K-Means algorithm works by initializing K-random centroid, assign each data point is to the nearest centroid, update the centroid by calculating the mean of each data point, and repeat until the centroids no longer change significantly. Besides that, Agglomerative works by assigning two nearest data point into one cluster and repeat it until the given number of cluster is satisfied.
